      <Line>Let’s take a look at the places we can explore!</Line>
      <Line>Prior to entering a stage, we can take a look at the obstacles and materials that we will encounter in this tab.</Line>
      <Line>This allows us to plan our approach before heading out!</Line>
      <Line>Remember to practice &lt;b&gt;problem decomposition.&lt;/b&gt; Break down the stage into smaller problems and identify the proper spells to bring you in order to accomplish the stage. </Line>
      <Line>Note that different stages also yield different materials we can use for crafting!</Line>
      <Line>We can choose to revisit certain places we have been to if we need to gather more resources there.</Line>
      <Line>Enough talk for now. I’m raring to go on our next expedition! Whenever you're ready, let’s head on to the next stage!</Line>
