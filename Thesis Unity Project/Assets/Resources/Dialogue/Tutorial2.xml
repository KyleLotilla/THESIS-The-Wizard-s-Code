			<Line>Welcome back! I hope you have prepared yourself.</Line>
			<Line>Remember the new spell you unlocked last time? Let’s test it out! Try to use it effectively to explore this stage.</Line>
			<Line>Always remember to &lt;b&gt;break down the area into smaller problems&lt;/b&gt;!</Line>
			<Line>Associate the obstacles you come across with your spells!</Line>
			<Line>Here's a few more tips before you begin.</Line>
			<Line>You can view the entire stage by pressing the &lt;b&gt;Zoom Out&lt;/b&gt; button and dragging the screen.</Line>
			<Line>That way you can already see the obstacles that you will run into.</Line>
			<Line>Then you can plan the spells you need to use or save in advance accordingly!</Line>
			<Line>You may also feel like your desired spells don’t spawn quite often in the action stack.</Line>
			<Line>If that happens, you can make use of the &lt;b&gt;reset&lt;/b&gt; button.</Line>
			<Line>The reset button will remove all the spells in the action stack and spawn new ones!.</Line>
			<Line>Use it wisely though, you can only reset for a limited number of times.</Line>
			<Line>Now let’s try to clear out the obstacles ahead of us using our spells. </Line>
			<Line>Be careful though, using an incorrect spell on an obstacle will deduct points from your score.</Line>
			<Line>I know you can do it! Let's go!</Line>
