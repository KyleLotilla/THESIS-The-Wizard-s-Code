## Description

"The Wizard's Code" is a 2d adventure puzzle educational game that aims to help teach [Computational Thinking](https://digitalpromise.org/initiative/computational-thinking/computational-thinking-for-next-generation-science/what-is-computational-thinking/). "The Wizard's Code" is similar to other educational games, such as [Lightbot](https://lightbot.com/), wherein the player controls a character through a [Block-based Programming Language](https://www.codejig.com/en/block-based-coding/). In the game, the player must overcome obstalces and reach the end of level. The player can do so by dragging **Action Blocks**, such as **Movement** and **Spells**, from the **Action Tab** and dropping them in the **Action Queue**, where the blocks are executed in sequence. Later, the player will be introduced to a mechanic called **Spellcodes**, which are action blocks that behaves similarly to functions in regular programming languages.
